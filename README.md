## SafeQ Inc.
## About
### Description
Realizing that social distancing has been one of the hottest topic in the past 2 years, my team has developed SafeQ, which I believe is the best solution for queueing during Covid-19. This solution enables people to arrive just-in-time for appointments, which significantly minimizes crowdedness of any office. SafeQ guarantees safe queueing environments!
### Words from Founder
As a founder of this project, my vision is to apply the use of technology, especially [MERN Stack](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-mern-stack), in carrying out social goods. I believe that this project has partially expressed how passionate I am along the road of becoming an innovative software engineer who craves for a better world. This project has a friendly design, which I hope will make your experience enjoyable. I'm also recruiting members to develop this project along my way of achieving my goal.
